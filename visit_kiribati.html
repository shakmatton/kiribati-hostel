This is the beauty of the isolation of the central pacific. Of course this exclusiveness is because these places can be a little challenging to get to – however you are in the right place to find out. Only for the truly adventurous surf traveler, below are the details you will need to arrange your surf trip of a life time, and waves you have only dreams about.</strong></p>

The culture of Kiribati is complex and diverse, with each island having its own unique ways. Though a living body, many people remain true to the century old traditions and practices that define what it means to be I-Kiribati. Cultural practices such as community meetings under the maneaba (traditional meeting house) to socialize and feast (a botaki), respect of elderly people, guest hospitality and importance of family remain important facets in the culture of Kiribati. We warmly welcome visitors in many of our customs and activities, and are proud of our way of life and its celebration. The way of living is very simple and people plan their living for a day only, without worrying about their future, living with the moto “Tomorrow is another day”.</strong></p>
